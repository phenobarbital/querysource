description: Start and complete a single SDD task from a per-spec index, implementing only its scoped files and committing code plus SDD state in the worktree.

# SDD Start

## Full procedure and Codex adaptations

Before executing, read the [full sdd-start procedure](../../../.claude/commands/sdd-start.md)
and the [Codex adaptation contract](../../../docs/sdd/CODEX.md#codex-adaptation-contract).
Follow the full procedure for details omitted from this summary. The adaptation
contract and the Codex-specific instructions below override Claude runtime syntax
and legacy shell examples; retain all workflow gates and evidence requirements.

Use this skill when the user asks to run `sdd-start`, pick up a task, or
implement a single SDD task.

Codex invocation: `$sdd-start TASK-NNN` or `$sdd-start <task-slug>`.

## Purpose

Resolve one task, validate dependencies, mark it in progress, implement it,
validate it, and close it in the same branch/worktree.

## Guardrails

- Do not start blocked tasks.
- Do not restart `done` tasks.
- Confirm before resuming an `in-progress` task unless the user explicitly asked
  to resume.
- Code and per-spec index state live together in the worktree.
- Touch only files listed in the task unless the user approves a scope update.
- Use `scripts.sdd.finalize_task`; do not hand-copy active tasks to completed.
- Commit only scoped files at each step.

## Workflow

## Deterministic task inspection and closure (FEAT-584)
Keep wiki-first and read the complete task contract through bounded references.
Prefer task-context inspection when the engine is present; fallback keeps explicit checks.
Use the existing declared test selector, environment protection and semantic delivery review.
Finalize only with structured green evidence and the exact implementation HEAD; call
python -m scripts.sdd.finalize_task, inspect returned staged paths and commit explicitly.
Reject stale evidence and divergent active/completed twins; never reset unrelated staging.
Do not compact for every task. Feature handoff uses a durable checkpoint and fresh reviewer;
Codex/Antigravity without a verified adapter report unsupported_host, never call Claude /compact.

1. Resolve task:
   - scan `sdd/tasks/index/*.json`, excluding `_orphans.json`
   - match task `id` or `slug`
   - if no input, run the equivalent of `$sdd-next` and ask the user to choose
2. Validate:
   - status must be `pending`, or explicitly confirmed `in-progress`
   - every dependency in `depends_on` must be `done`
3. Ensure the worktree before changing task state (FEAT-552):
   - resolve `feature`, `feature_id`, `spec`, `type`, and `base_branch` from the index header
   - run `python -m scripts.sdd.ensure_worktree --slug <feature-slug> --feature-id <FEAT-ID> --spec <spec-path> --index sdd/tasks/index/<feature-slug>.json`
   - for hotfixes pass `--jira-key <KEY>` instead of `--feature-id`
   - on a non-zero exit, STOP and report the error; never fall back to implementing on `base_branch`
   - on success, enter the returned worktree path and re-read its task/index before proceeding
   - the helper is idempotent when already inside the correct worktree
4. Mark in progress:
   - update only the task entry in `sdd/tasks/index/<feature>.json`
   - set `status: in-progress`
   - set `started_at`
   - preserve unrelated staging; stage only the index and verify cached names
   - commit `sdd: start TASK-NNN - <title>`
   - (FEAT-566, best-effort) append `task.started` to the shared ledger's
     `events.jsonl` — log-only, never blocks on failure (missing ledger
     package, unwritable shared root); same pattern as `close_task.sh`'s
     `task.closed` emission (`LedgerEvent`/`LedgerLog`, no SQLite writer
     involved, so no contention to handle)
5. Read context:
   - full task file
   - referenced spec file
   - scope
   - files to create/modify
   - Codebase Contract
   - implementation notes
   - acceptance criteria
   - test specification
5b. Prime with ledger context (FEAT-566, best-effort):
   - `wikitoolkit ledger context <files-from-scope> 2>/dev/null || true`
   - fold non-empty output into context; never fatal on a busy/unbuilt ledger
6. Print kickoff summary, then continue immediately.
7. Verify Codebase Contract before editing:
   - confirm every import exists
   - confirm every signature still matches
   - respect "Does NOT Exist"
   - update the task contract first if a verified reference is stale
8. Implement:
   - edit/create only task-scoped files
   - use specified classes, methods, signatures, and patterns
   - follow repo instructions in `AGENTS.md` and `.agent/CONTEXT.md`

#### Delegated implementation (only when the task has `## Delegation Contract`)

Use this branch ONLY when the task file contains a `## Delegation Contract`
section AND the `parrot-targeted-writer` MCP server is available. Otherwise
implement the task yourself — the normal route is the default.

1. Call MCP tool `writer_generate` (server `parrot-targeted-writer`) with `task_path`.
2. On `status: error` with a contract code (`stale_target`, `missing_block`,
   `placeholder_code`, `underspecified_create`, …): fix the packet in the task file
   (refresh hashes with `sha256sum`, complete the design) and retry once, or implement
   the task yourself. The workflow **never silently invokes another coder** — no other
   coding tool is substituted when delegation fails.
3. On `ok`: read `data.patch_path` with `source_read` in ranges of at most 350 lines and
   review EVERY hunk against the task's Codebase Contract. Never apply a patch you have
   not fully read. If a hunk is wrong, do not apply: fix the packet/blocks and regenerate
   at most once more, else implement normally.
4. Call `writer_apply` with `artifact_id` and `reviewed_sha256 = data.patch_sha256`
   (verify it equals `sha256sum artifacts/tool-optimizations/<id>/patch.diff`).
5. Run the task's acceptance tests yourself. The writer never runs tests; a model's claim
   that tests passed is not execution evidence.
6. Continue with the normal validate → commit → SDD state steps. SDD files
   (`sdd/tasks/index/*.json`, task files) are never edited by the writer.

9. Validate:
   - run task-specified tests
   - run task-specified lint/format checks
   - store test logs in `artifacts/logs/` when logs are persisted
   - fix failures within scope
   - stop after three failed attempts if the failure is not understood
10. Commit code:
    - preserve unrelated staging; stop before committing if it is not task-owned
    - stage only files listed for the task
    - verify cached names
    - commit `feat(<feature-slug>): TASK-NNN - <title>`
11. Close task:
    - read `TaskCompletionEvidence`
      (`parrot.flows.dev_loop.sdd_coder.optimization_models`, loaded from the
      parrot-sdd-coder runtime by `scripts/sdd/finalize_task.py` — parrot is not
      a querysource dependency) and create its JSON with the task ID, feature slug, exact implementation
      HEAD, durable green validation references, semantic review evidence and
      any correction commits; never fabricate evidence or passing outcomes
    - run `python -m scripts.sdd.finalize_task --evidence <path> --worktree <path> --expected-head <full HEAD SHA>`
    - on failure, report the evidence/state problem; do not use `close_task.sh`
      as a fallback or hand-edit the Completion Note
    - inspect returned `staged_paths` and `removed_paths`; verify cached names
      include only this task's per-spec index and moved task file
    - commit using the returned suggested message without a pathspec, so the
      already-staged deletion of the active copy is included
12. Report next task or suggest `$sdd-done FEAT-NNN` when complete.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and report if:

- SDD files are missing.
- dependency state is inconsistent.
- task contradicts the spec.
- required changes are outside task scope.
- a necessary import/signature cannot be verified.
- tests still fail after three focused attempts.
- implementation diverges from file/class/interface fidelity.
