# SDD Spec

## Full procedure and Codex adaptations

Before executing, read the [full sdd-spec procedure](../../../.claude/commands/sdd-spec.md)
and the [Codex adaptation contract](../../../docs/sdd/CODEX.md#codex-adaptation-contract).
Follow the full procedure for details omitted from this summary. The adaptation
contract and the Codex-specific instructions below override Claude runtime syntax
and legacy shell examples; retain all workflow gates and evidence requirements.

Use this skill when the user asks to run `sdd-spec`, create a formal SDD
specification, or convert a brainstorm/proposal into a spec.

Codex invocation: `$sdd-spec [<feature-slug>] [--type feature|hotfix] [--base-branch <branch>] [--interview | --no-interview] [--resume [<staging-dir>]] [--research full|light|none] [--no-gate] [--budget tight|default|loose] [-- <notes>]`.

## Purpose

Create `sdd/specs/<feature-slug>.spec.md`, the single source of truth for a
feature or hotfix.

## Guardrails

- Do not implement code.
- Use `sdd/templates/spec.md`.
- Preserve YAML frontmatter.
- If prior exploration exists, consume it before asking the user questions.
- Never re-ask brainstorm questions marked `[x]`; carry answers forward
  verbatim and route them into the correct spec sections.
- Build a verified Codebase Contract with file paths and line numbers.
- Identify delegation-eligible modules (see the workflow note below).
- Commit only the spec and this run's promoted design-research/intake artifacts.

## Workflow

#### Identify delegation-eligible modules

While writing §3 Module Breakdown, fill the "Delegation-eligible modules"
sub-table: for each module state whether its design is complete enough that
implementing it is mechanical, and record the decided patterns and exact
contracts (signatures, error codes, file layout). Architecture decisions
stay with the thinking model — eligibility never delegates a design choice.

1. Parse:
   - feature slug
   - free-form notes after `--`
   - optional `--type`
   - optional `--base-branch`
   - intake flags (FEAT-577): with no brainstorm/proposal and no notes (or
     with `--interview`), run intake mode by following
     `sdd/templates/intake.procedure.md`; never in a non-interactive run.
2. Locate prior exploration:
   - `sdd/proposals/<feature-slug>.brainstorm.md`
   - `sdd/proposals/<feature-slug>.proposal.md`
3. If a brainstorm exists, treat it as authoritative:
   - Problem Statement -> Motivation
   - Constraints -> Goals and Acceptance Criteria
   - Recommendation -> Architectural Overview
   - Feature Description -> Overview, Integration Points, Risks
   - Capabilities -> Module Breakdown
   - Impact table -> Integration Points
   - Code Context -> Codebase Contract, after re-verification
   - Libraries -> External Dependencies
   - Parallelism Assessment -> Worktree Strategy
   - Open Questions -> preserve `[x]` and `[ ]`
4. Resolve flow metadata with `scripts.sdd.sdd_meta.resolve_flow()`:
   - explicit flags win
   - exploration frontmatter is next
   - default is `type: feature`, `base_branch: dev`
5. Validate:
   - hotfix requires `main`
   - feature must not use `main`
6. Sync base branch:
   - refuse if inside `.claude/worktrees/`
   - refuse dirty worktree
   - `git checkout <base_branch>`
   - `git pull --ff-only origin <base_branch>`
7. Ask clarifying questions only for real blockers:
   - missing target version/status/author preferences
   - unresolved questions that block design
   - contradictions discovered during codebase research
8. Research codebase:
   - run `wikitoolkit query "<focused question>"` before source scans
   - inspect at least one wiki result when available
   - use `rg`
   - read every file before citing imports, methods, classes, signatures, or
     paths
   - record plausible things that do not exist
8b. Optional independent design research, before drafting the spec:
   - when prior exploration is accepted or intake reached `rounds_complete`,
     follow the full procedure's collaborative research step using
     `sdd/templates/design_research.prompt.md` and its schema
   - supply only accepted input and verified code anchors, never your draft or
     preferred conclusion; use a separate read-only reviewer, not this session
   - bound execution, validate affected paths for repository containment and
     existence, and disposition every suggestion as CONFIRM/REJECT/ESCALATE
   - persist the brief, raw output and triage in run-scoped staging; fill §9
     Design Research Cross-Check, or record the concrete skip reason
   - this optional step never blocks spec creation when the capability fails
9. Resolve identity before reserving:
   - For `type: feature`, first check whether this slug already owns an ID in
     `sdd/specs/<feature-slug>.spec.md` and its per-spec index. Preserve that
     existing FEAT-ID on regeneration; never reserve a replacement. If the
     spec and index disagree, stop and report the mismatch.
   - If frontmatter has `reuse_feature_id`, use it only for an intentional
     multi-spec split, document the reuse, and skip reservation.
   - Only for a new feature without an existing or explicitly reused ID, call:
     `python -m scripts.sdd.reserve_ids --kind feature --count 1 --base-branch <base_branch> --label <feature-slug>`.
   - Use the returned `FEAT-NNN` verbatim.
   - Do not fall back to hand-computed IDs.
   - For `type: hotfix`, reserve no `FEAT-NNN`; use the Jira key as identity
     when available.
10. Write the spec:
   - frontmatter `type` and `base_branch`
   - frontmatter `projects` and `tags`, carried from the exploration doc (FEAT-576)
   - ID or Jira identity
   - date
   - architecture and module breakdown
   - Interface Skeletons for every module: public signatures and docstrings,
     with `verified: path:NN` anchors for existing code, and no implementation
     bodies. `$sdd-task` derives its Implementation Blueprints from these.
   - an Edit Sites table in §6 for every file the modules modify: the verbatim
     attachment anchor, `path:NN`, and its occurrence count verified with
     `grep -c`. Record the base commit used for verification. When an anchor
     is non-unique, include two or three lines of surrounding context; list
     only actual module files. For created files, record the path only.
   - tests and acceptance criteria
   - mandatory Codebase Contract
   - Worktree Strategy
   - Open Questions with resolved/unresolved state preserved
11. Commit:
   - preserve unrelated staging; stop before committing if it is outside this run's scope
   - stage `sdd/specs/<feature-slug>.spec.md` and only this run's promoted artifacts
   - promote design research into `sdd/state/<FEAT-ID>/design_research/`
   - for intake, set `feat_id`, `phase: committed` and `updated_at` in
     `intake.json`, then promote into `sdd/state/<FEAT-ID>/intake/`
   - never overwrite existing promoted directories; retain staging and report
     the collision for inspection; preserve source artifacts until copying succeeds
   - verify cached names
   - commit `sdd: add spec for FEAT-NNN - <feature-slug>` for features, or a
     hotfix equivalent for hotfixes

## Output

For features:

```text
Spec created and committed: sdd/specs/<feature-slug>.spec.md
Feature ID: FEAT-NNN
Isolation: per-spec|mixed
Next: review, mark approved, run $sdd-task sdd/specs/<feature-slug>.spec.md
```

For hotfixes:

```text
Spec created and committed: sdd/specs/<feature-slug>.spec.md
Identity: Jira <KEY> or hotfix slug
Base branch: main
Next: normally skip task decomposition and dispatch direct development; run
$sdd-task only for unusually large hotfixes.
```
