## Codebase Knowledge Graph (LLM Wiki)

This repository maintains a machine-first knowledge graph of the
codebase (pages + typed edges over a local SQLite plane, built by
`wikitoolkit build`). For ANY question about the codebase — where
something lives, how modules relate, what a subsystem does — you MUST
run a scoped wiki query FIRST, before Grep/Glob/Read or any shell
search (`grep`/`rg`/`find`/`cat` via Bash):

- `wikitoolkit query "<question>"` — token-budgeted, ranked page
  stubs for a scoped question. ALWAYS start here.
- `wikitoolkit page <id>` — read one page in full (file summaries,
  API outlines, content). Use the ids returned by `query`.
- `wikitoolkit related <id>` — follow typed edges (`contains`,
  `references`) to neighbouring files/modules.
- `wikitoolkit status` — plane statistics and staleness.
- `wikitoolkit build` — refresh the graph after large changes
  (a git post-commit hook may already keep it fresh).

These same operations are also exposed as native MCP tools —
`wiki_query`, `wiki_page`, `wiki_related`, `wiki_remember`, `wiki_note`,
`wiki_status` — via the `wikitoolkit` MCP stdio server registered in
this repo's `.mcp.json` (FEAT-403). If they appear in your tool list,
prefer calling them directly; they have equal standing with Grep/Read
at tool-selection time instead of competing via a Bash-invoked CLI.

**Symbol lookup and blast radius (FEAT-498).** For a specific
function/class/method — not a general question — prefer the structural
tools over `wiki_query`: `wikitoolkit symbols lookup <name>`
(`wiki_symbol_lookup` MCP tool) finds it by name/qualname directly;
`wikitoolkit symbols outline <file>` (`wiki_code_outline`) lists a
file's symbols before you read the whole thing; `wikitoolkit symbols
blast <symbol>` (`wiki_blast_radius`) shows every symbol that
transitively calls/extends/implements it — run this BEFORE editing a
widely-used function or class to see what you might break.

**Query discipline** (avoids the two most common ways the wiki
"fails" — which are usually caller error, not missing coverage):

1. **Query for the *thing*, not for your *hypothesis* about it.** The
   ranking is lexical — extra concept words steer it toward those
   concepts. To locate a class or feature, name the symbol/module/
   subsystem you want (`"attestation model service"`), not your theory
   about where it might live.
2. **Follow the thread before falling back.** If a result scores low
   or names a parent module, resolve it with `wikitoolkit page <id>`
   or `wikitoolkit related <id>` — one hop usually lands the real
   page. Do NOT jump to grep just because the first `query` didn't
   rank the exact page first.

Only fall back to Grep/Glob/Read (or shell search) once a clean query
*and* a page/related follow-up have genuinely come up empty — and say
so before you do. Consider `wikitoolkit build` if results look stale.

**Saving knowledge (persistent memory).** The wiki is also your
durable memory — what you save here survives this session and is
found by future `wikitoolkit query` calls ("the agent forgets, the
graph does not"). When you learn a durable fact, make a decision, or
extract a lesson worth keeping, SAVE it:

- `wikitoolkit remember "<fact>" --category [note|decision|lesson|concept]
  [--title "<short title>"] [--link <page_id> --rel <relation>]` —
  file new knowledge (idempotent: same title+category updates the
  existing memory). Link it to the pages it is about.
- `wikitoolkit note <page_id> "<text>"` — append an attributed,
  dated note to an existing page.
- `wikitoolkit link <src_id> <dst_id> --rel <relation>` — connect
  two pages with a typed, asserted edge.
- `wikitoolkit memories` — list saved memories;
  `wikitoolkit audit` — the attributed write log.

Save selectively: durable decisions, gotchas, and cross-file
relationships — not session chatter. Every write is attributed and
auditable.

The `/parrotwiki` command wraps these (e.g. `/parrotwiki query how
does ingest work`, `/parrotwiki remember <fact>`, `/parrotwiki --wiki`
to export a human-readable markdown wiki).
